        <h2>Romeo and Juliet</h2>
        <p class="article-p">
          The play Romeo and Juliet is written by the world-famous poet Shakespeare. The play is a tragic love story
          resulting in the death of Romeo, and Juliet, the star-crossed lovers. Throughout the book, multiple factors
          contribute to the end of the lovers. For example, the feud between the Montagues and the Capulets, the
          banishment of Romeo, and the faked death of Juliet.
          <br><br>

          The main factor that drove the tragic end was the family feud between the Montagues and Capulets. The
          Capulet-Montague rivalry was responsible for the deaths of Romeo and Juliet because it got in the way of their
          love for each other. If not for the feud, they would have been able to express their love openly. If there
          were no feud, Mercutio would not have died at the hands of Tybalt, Tybalt would not have been killed at the
          hands of Romeo, and Romeo would not have been banished.
          <br><br>
          Some might argue that the hateful relationship between the two families wasn't influential towards Romeo and
          Juliet's death. Romeo and Juliet knew that they were from families who wouldn't support their marriage, but
          that didn't stop the two lovers from continuing their affair. Romeo and Juliet also knew that their families
          did not believe in divorce, so since they were already married, their parents could do nothing. Although the
          families were significantly involved in the lovers' deaths, if you read it, you would understand how much
          their families hated each other. Even if they did not believe in divorce, they could have quickly done
          something drastic. For example, Juliet's father could have had Romeo killed.
          <br><br>
          Another main factor was Romeo being banished. Juliet's cousin Tybalt murdered Romeo's cousin Mercutio because
          of his severe hatred toward Montagues. Romeo murders Tybalt to avenge Mercutio, his favourite cousin. Earlier
          in the day, there was a massive brawl between the Montagues and Capulets. The Prince of Verona had enough of
          the constant violence in the streets and announced that if there were another fight between the two families,
          it would result in the immediate death of the parties involved. Since Tybalt started the war with Mercutio, he
          would have been sentenced to death anyway. The Prince realized this and had mercy on Romeo, so instead of
          punishing him to death for murdering Tybalt, he banished him from the kingdom instead. Romeo being banished
          meant Juliet only had two options, finding a way to run away with Romeo or marrying Paris. Juliet chose to run
          away with Romeo.
          <br><br>
          Some might argue that Romeo's banishment should have made the two lovers happy. Since Romeo was being forced
          to leave Verona, it would have been the perfect opportunity for them to start over as a newly wedded couple.
          If they both left, they would have to worry about their family feud. They would be wrong, though, because
          there were only three ways Juliet could have left with him, telling her parents they were married and she was
          going with him, running away without telling them or faking her death to run away. She could not have told her
          parents because she had no idea how they would react or if they would let her leave since they were already
          set that their only heir would marry Paris. If she ran away in the middle of the night without saying
          anything, her parents would have sent out a search party and found her eventually since she was just in the
          second town over. Juliet did try to fake her death and the results ended in both of them committing suicide
          for each other.
          <br><br>
          The final contributing factor to the death of Romeo and Juliet is when Juliet and Friar Lawerence come up with
          a plan to help Juliet run away with Romeo. When Romeo was banished, Juliet and Romeo had already gotten
          secretly married, and in Juliet's eyes, it was only common sense to follow her husband, so Friar Lawrence gave
          her a potion that would make her heart and lungs stop working for two days. The reason Friar Lawerence gave
          her the brew was so everyone in the kingdom would think she was dead that way, and she could meet Romeo when
          she woke up in 2 days. Friar Lawerance sent a message to Romeo explaining all the details of their plan, but
          it never reached him. Once Romeo heard that Juliet had died, he bought some poison and went to Juliet's death
          bed. He drank the poison because he wanted to forever be with Juliet in the afterlife, but as soon as he drank
          it, Juliet woke up and found her lover dead with the poison beside him. When Juliet realized what happened,
          she stabbed herself so she could be with him forever in the afterlife. The whole thing could have been avoided
          if Juliet and Friar Lawrence had chosen a different way for Juliet to escape, if the letter had reached Romeo,
          or if Juliet and Romeo came clean to their families about their relationship.
          <br><br>
          Some might argue that Friar would be to blame for everything. Friar Lawrence should have hand-delivered the
          letter instead of giving it to Friar John or should have run to Juliet's side once he found out the letter
          didn't reach him. Friar Lawrence was also the one who married them and gave Juliet the potion. Although Friar
          Lawrence does fault in the situation, Romeo and Juliet are two consulting adults. They chose to go to him and
          listened to him; he did not force them to do anything, he was even reluctant at first, but Romeo persuaded
          him. Juliet was also the one that threatened to kill herself if he didn't give her a plan. He also could have
          never known Friar John would not reach Romeo with the letter.
          <br><br>
          In conclusion, the death and drama could have been avoided if the two lovers had told their families they were
          in love. They could have ended the feud between the two families, and then Tybalt would not have killed
          Mercutio, avoiding the banishment of Romeo. If Romeo were not banished, Juliet would not have faked her death,
          and then Romeo would not have killed himself.
